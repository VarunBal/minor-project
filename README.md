# Nutrition-detection

The primary goal of the project is to detect food items in real time and
present its nutritional and calorific values at the same time.

The detection is based on OpenCV and using HAAR feature-based
cascade classifiers. It takes a machine learning based approach where a
cascade function is trained on a lot of positive and negative images. It is
then used to detect objects in other images.

The processes involved were:

### Gathering dataset:

##### Negative samples
